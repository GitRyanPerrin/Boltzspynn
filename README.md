While this repository is not in a real, "sharable" condition, I figured I would set it public.

I) The Hamiltonians considered are for a [111] nanowire, and there is some leftovers considering a simplified form of a nanoscroll.
  - The particular details that determine the type of nanowire (nanoscroll) is the Dresselhaus Hamiltonian
  - The Rashba Hamiltonian is consistent between the two, due to the direction of the electric field caused by the assumed interface

II) First-order charge and second-order spin transport are possible
  - Without consideration of a Berry Curvature, or a magnetic field, the charge transport only exists in first-order
  - Similarly, spin transport only exists in second order
    - Furthermore, we consider only longitudinal transport which dictates that only the azimuthal spin orientation exists--a consequence of the integration of the second-order distribution function

III) Other considerations occur in this repository, but are likely more niche or experimental. The Hamiltonian, velocities, and conductivities are the main focus for my research.
